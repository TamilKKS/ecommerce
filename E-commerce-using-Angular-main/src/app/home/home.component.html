      Bel Fuse’s polymer formulation positive temperature coefficient (PTC) devices offer circuit protection and an
      added resettable feature in low-profile, SMT packages. The Bel PTC consists of a block of polymeric material
      containing conductive carbon granules that is sandwiched between two conductive metal plates. When this polymer
      block reaches approximately 125oC, either due to current passing through it via conductive chains of carbon
      particles or due to an external heat source; it swells volumetrically. This expansion breaks apart a majority of
      the chains of carbon granules that run between the two conductive plates. This behavior results in a sharp
      increase in resistance across the two plates, which all but eliminates current flow through the device, allowing
      just enough residual current flow to maintain the block’s internal temperature at 125oC. Once this “tripped” state
      current is cut off, the polymer brick cools and shrinks to its original size, thereby allowing the broken carbon
      chains to reestablish themselves and permit the part to return to its low resistance state. Once cooled to room
      ambient, the PTC will reset. This reset-ability protects electronic equipment, which remains fully functional, and
      eliminates the need for service personnel to physically replace a fuse. This behavior allows the fuses to protect
      against harmful overcurrent, short circuit conditions, and over temperature conditions not necessarily caused by
      excessive current. The surface mount series of resettable PTC devices are all AEC-Q200 compliant, have an
      operating temperature of -40°C to +85°C, offer voltage ratings from 6 to 60 Volts DC, and an operating hold
      current range from 10 milliamps all the way up to 5 amps.

      iological visual systems have inspired the development of various artificial visual systems including those based
      on human eyes (terrestrial environment), insect eyes (terrestrial environment) and fish eyes (aquatic
      environment). However, attempts to develop systems for both terrestrial and aquatic environments remain limited,
      and bioinspired electronic eyes are restricted in their maximum field of view to a hemispherical field of view
      (around 180°). Here we report the development of an amphibious artificial vision system with a panoramic visual
      field inspired by the functional and anatomical structure of the compound eyes of a fiddler crab. We integrate a
      microlens array with a graded refractive index and a flexible comb-shaped silicon photodiode array on a spherical
      structure. The microlenses have a flat surface and maintain their focal length regardless of changes in the
      external refractive index between air and water. The comb-shaped image sensor arrays on the spherical substrate
      exhibit an extremely wide field of view covering almost the entire spherical geometry. We illustrate the
      capabilities of our system via optical simulations and imaging demonstrations in both air and
